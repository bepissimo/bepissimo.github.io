      The lego box is an idea I've been toying with for the better part of a year now. <br>
      When I was in elementary school, I had unbridled creativity and felt no creative limitations or insecurities, academic or otherwise. <br>
      However, as I progressed through school, I lost a lot of that creativity and my passion to just <strong>create</strong> for the sake of <strong>creation.</strong><br>
      If I created something, it had to be for a purpose, whether it be to improve my comprehension of a topic or to satisfy a requirement. <br>
      I was also comparing my work to others' around me.  This made me incredibly insecure, and almost made me scared to be creative at all. <br>
      I always felt like no matter how hard I tried, nothing I made could stand up to the works of my peers. <br>
      <strong>That's why this page exists. </strong> <br>
      One of my fondest memories growing up was having a large red lego box full of disassembled kits.  <br>
      I would then use these pieces to build new things, completely out of my imagination. <br>
      Although they never looked as good as what came from the original kit, they were <strong>my own creations.</strong> <br>
      I never expected them to accomplish anything or be of noteworthy quality.  I just wanted to have fun. <br>
      That's what lies ahead on the button below. <br>
      By pressing the button below, you will probably find nothing of quality. <br>
      It won't be impressive.  Compared to what others are making, it will be arguably worthless. <br>
      If you're looking for impressive creations, <strong>don't waste your time.</strong> <br>
      Go back to LinkedIn.  I'm sure people have plenty of things to brag about over there.  <br>
      All I can assure you is that what is created is <i>mine.</i> <br>
      Everything below is created <i>purely out of passion.</i><br>
