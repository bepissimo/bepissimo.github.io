          Howdy!  My name is Ben Peterson.  I am an upcoming sophomore at CU Boulder pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science as well as a leadership minor. 
          I am also a part of the 2020 Cohort of the Presidents LEadership Class (PLC).
          Currently, I am interested in quantum computing, software development, and computational biology.
          Outside of school, I like rock climbing, weight lifting, skiing, tennis, and meditation.
